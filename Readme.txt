Hullo all!
Just a quick note.
I got annoyed with having to put in 40,000 tooltips into my program, so I wrote this as a little side project. I have not tested it much, and it is probably full of bugs. Enjoy using it, it makes my life easier.
To use it, you will have to do 2 things.
first of all, you will have to register the DLL file.
secondly, you will have to add to C:\windows\vbaddin.ini this line:
ToolTip.Connect=0
under the [addins-32] heading.
Then you can launch the program from the add-ins menu in VB.

If you like this, or find a bug, or want to use it, just want to talk VB, or whatever, please send me an e-mail!

Thanks all, Jolyon Bloomfield

P.S. I enclose the code for you to look at. If you want to user some of it, please give me credit. I must admit, it is not the best code to look at, as VB addin programming is rather messy, and me being fairly unexperienced (before i started, anyway) with VB addin programming... u tell me the rest. Anyway, enjoy it, and I hope you learn from it.
P.P.S. Can anybody tell me how to get my own icon for an ActiveX DLL file (when viewed in explorer?), instead of the crappy old VB one?


After running it once, and changing the project, VB crashed... I dunno why, but I'll look into it. I'm posting this anyway, and will post an updated version a little later.
