## A simple ToolTip Addin


</div>

### Description

This code creates a "ToolTip Addin" that enumerates all objects in a form that have a "Tooltip" property, and allows you to edit them quickly from a listbox, instead of setting them one by one. I wrote this because I couldn't be bothered to use 20,000 tooltips the hard way... Note, this is by no means an easy task, and I still am wrinkling bugs out of it. Read the Readme.txt file inside. It should be able to give you a (flimsy) idea of how to use the addin stuff though. (I still don't really get it...)
